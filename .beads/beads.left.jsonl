Or manual bd export -o .beads/issues.jsonl\n3. Parsing JSONL on every refresh\n\nPerformance issues:\n- User sees empty TUI until first export completes\n- Must wait 30s or manually export after creating issues\n- JSONL parsing overhead on every refresh\n- File watching detects changes but data is stale\n\nProposed solution: Read .beads/beads.db directly\n- Instant access to latest data\n- No export delay\n- SQLite query performance \u003e JSONL parsing\n- Can still watch .beads/beads.db for changes\n\nImplementation options:\n1. Use beads reference source in ./beads/ as guide\n2. Copy minimal storage/sqlite package\n3. Import beads as library (if possible)\n\nChild tasks to create if we proceed:\n- Research beads SQLite schema\n- Implement direct DB reader\n- Add DB file watcher instead of JSONL\n- Handle schema version compatibility\n- Test with real beads databases\n\nDecision needed: Is direct DB access worth the complexity vs fixing JSONL export delay?","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-14T08:37:18.904620369-05:00","updated_at":"2025-11-14T08:37:30.973257644-05:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"tui-1oj","depends_on_id":"tui-ywv","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-11-14T08:37:18.905506137-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
