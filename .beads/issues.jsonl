Use beads reference source in ./beads/ as guide\n2. Copy minimal storage/sqlite package\n3. Import beads as library (if possible)\n\nChild tasks to create if we proceed:\n- Research beads SQLite schema\n- Implement direct DB reader\n- Add DB file watcher instead of JSONL\n- Handle schema version compatibility\n- Test with real beads databases\n\nDecision needed: Is direct DB access worth the complexity vs fixing JSONL export delay?","notes":"UPDATED EVALUATION:\n\nACTUAL PROBLEM DISCOVERED:\n- Daemon export has been blocked for ~1 hour\n- Error: \"JSONL is newer than database (import first to avoid data loss)\"\n- This causes TUI to show indefinitely stale data\n- Requires manual bd export --force to resolve\n\nJSONL APPROACH PROBLEMS (real):\n- Export blocks on timestamp mismatch (safety mechanism)\n- Can happen from: git operations, manual edits, clock skew\n- When blocked, no automatic recovery\n- User sees stale data with no indication why\n\nSQLITE APPROACH BENEFITS (real):\n- Eliminates timestamp mismatch issues entirely\n- Always shows current operational state\n- No manual intervention needed\n- Still has: schema coupling, git misalignment, complexity\n\nALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS:\n1. Auto-force export - daemon resolves conflicts automatically\n2. TUI DB fallback - read DB when JSONL stale\n3. Hybrid - read DB for display, watch JSONL for git changes\n\nRECOMMENDATION CHANGED: Implement hybrid approach\n- Primary read: SQLite (always current)\n- Watch JSONL for git sync events (pulls/merges)\n- Schema coupling acceptable for this use case\n- Complexity justified by reliability improvement\n\nOriginal \"700ms latency\" concern was wrong - real issue is staleness/blocking.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-14T08:37:18.904620369-05:00","updated_at":"2025-11-14T09:54:57.255275479-05:00","closed_at":"2025-11-14T09:54:57.255275479-05:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"tui-1oj","depends_on_id":"tui-ywv","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-11-14T08:37:18.905506137-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
